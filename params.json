{"name":"WaoN","tagline":"is a Wave-to-Notes transcriber","body":"### Welcome to WaoN Pages.\r\nWaoN is a Wave-to-Notes transcriber, that is, the inverse of timidity by Tuukka Toivonen (and its descendants timidity++). (\"WaoN\" also has a meaning of harmony of notes or chord in Japanese!) My original intention is to pick up voicing of harmony from sound of my favorite pianists. (I have no talent to do so, but computer will :-) But there is no functional application of this kind on Unix platform, as far as I know. So I began writing this WaoN by myself.\r\n\r\nCurrently, WaoN contains three programs:\r\n* waon: transcriber (wav-to-mid converter)\r\n* pv: phase vocoder for time-streching and pitch-shifting\r\n* gwaon: GUI for waon and pv\r\n\r\n### License\r\nWaoN is released under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nKengo Ichiki (@kichiki)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
